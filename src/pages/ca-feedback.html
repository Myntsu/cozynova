            Xeror: currently the most OP in the meta. Either the possibility of safe place (3 dashes), high damage or simply the perma-healing with bite & run, makes him really strong against, almost, everybody.

            AOS characters: still feels a bit underwhelming, but it's going into the right direction. Perhaps a possibility of using their 3s light attack teleport in a way to improve their stability in the current meta.
